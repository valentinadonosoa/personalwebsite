                <h1>Stories as Networks</h1>
                <p>Choose one short story and set the text using HTML and CSS (JS optional) so that the reader will not only be able to read the story but also experience your interpretation of the story.  Use the visual language of the web—hypertext, responsive design, forms, color, divs—to express the meaning of your selected story.</p>

                <h1>Elastic Collection</h1>
                <p>Create a collection of 25 to 50 items using Airtable and Javascript. Your collection should have at least five different data types affiliated with it, and should be as specific as possible. There should be a visual consistency between the items, and should have a cohesive story to it.</p>

                <h1>New York City in Data</h1>
                <p>Using the New York City open data, you will select a dataset to work with. Look through your chosen data and consider how you can tell a story through different subsets of it — you do not need to include all of it. Consider the relationship between the form, the story, and the data itself. How does the data’s container help encourage an understanding of the data not possible without it? </p>

                <h1>Film Strip</h1>
                <p>Find a scene from a TV show, movie, or video and gather at least 20 screenshots of frames from that scene to piece together a film strip. Create a website using css grids that reconstruct the scene using the screenshots in a linear fashion. Each scene frame should include the screenshot and a title, description, or dialogue subtitle to give context to the scene.</p>

                <h1>Media Tunnel</h1>
                <p>Create a story that moves between a desktop and mobile-size browser. Think of this as a single, linear experience that travels between screen sizes to change content as the story progresses. The story can change between screen sizes as many times as you’d like, but must do so at least twice (at least once in desktop, and at least once in mobile).</p>

                <h1>Visual Conversation</h1>
                <p>Choose a conversation between at least two subjects from any source you’d like. Design and build a website that creatively explores the dialogue between each subject. Think about how you can visually illustrate which subject is speaking at what moment, the inflections and tone they are using, and how the conversation unfolds over time. </p>

                <h1>JSON Data</h1>
                <p>Select a subject you’d like to collect data about and gather at least 20 data points on that subject. Each data point should consist of at least 2 properties. From that data, create an array of JSON objects for each data point. Once you have your json objects, create a website which creatively displays the data using the techniques from past assignments (grids, hover states, media queries, etc.). </p>
